The "real" success factors on projects:

Question 1: What factors are critical to project management success?

	- On-time performance factors:
		- adequacy of company-wide education on the concepts of risk management
		- maturity of an organizatio's processes for assigning ownership of risks
		- adequacy with which a visible risk register is maintained
		- adequacy of an up-to-date risk management plan
		- adequacy of documentation of organisational responsabilies on the project
		- keep project duration as far below 3 years as possible

	- Cost performance factors:
		- Allow changes to scope only through a mature scope change control process
		- Maintain the integrity of the performance measurement baseline

Question 2: What factors are critical to success on an individual project?
	
	- Delivering project success is necessarily more difficult than delivering project 
	management success

	- The existence of an effective benefits delivery and management process that involves the 
	mutual co-operation of project management and line management functions

Question 3: What factors lead to consistently successful projects?

	- Portfolio and programme management practices taht allow the enterprise to resource fully
	a suite of projects that are throughtfully and dynamically matched to the corporate 
	strategy and business objectives.

	- A suite of project, programme and portfolio metrics that provides direct "line of sight" 
	feedback on current project performance, and anticipated future success, so that the 
	project , portfolio and corporate decisions can be aligned.

	- An effective means of "learning from experience" on projects, that combines explicit 
	knowledge with tacit knowledge in a way that encourages people to learn and to embed that 
	learning into continuous improvement of project management processes and practices.


How project success and corporate success are linked:
	
	- General corporate strategy:
		- Successful Business process Reengineering projects can lead directly to improve 
		competitiveness.
		- Successful corporate restructuring or merger/aquisition projects can lead directly 
		to enchanced shareholder value.

	- Business operations:
		- If the business is essentially project-based then successful project performance 
		translates directly into an improved bottom-line.
		- If the business is operations-based, then successful projects to support or to 
		improve operations lead indirectly to improved bottom-line performance.

	- Research and development:
		- Successful research projects and development projects lead to a maximised return on 
		R&D spend, leading directly to the creation of new streams of operating revenue.
		- Successful development projects improve time to market, and can enhance competitive 
		position, product sales or product margins.

	- IT/IS development:
		-Successful IT/IS projects deliver improved financial benefits and/or reduced wastage 
		of aborted projects.

	- Facilities provision and management:
		- Successful projects to design, procure and construct new capital assets can enhance 
		time to market, return on investment, reduced operating costs or some combination of 
		all three.
