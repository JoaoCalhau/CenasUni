Project Euler solutions
=======================

This package contains Nayuki Minase's solution code for over 180 Project Euler
problems.

Each solved problem has a program written in Java. Additionally, some solutions
have Mathematica and Haskell programs. All problems from #1 to #100 are solved.
For some solutions, the source code includes a detailed explanation of the
mathematics involved in order to justify the logic in the program.
