Managing the behaviour of people working in teams

The basic behaviours in the project-management method are not new. These behaviours can be 
easily remembered with the help of an acronym, COST:
	- C: Customer focus
	- O: Ownership
	- S: System for planning leading and controlling work
	- T: Teamwork

Customer:
	- One's first opportunity to produce defective work is to misunderstand the customer's 
	needs or to err in communicating with the costumer.

	- By improving costumer communications and relations, reworks and costly changes made 
	during project execution are reduced, and project quality increses.

	- All treatments of the management of quality begin with customer satisfaction and being 
	close to one's customers.

	- In this method, project teams are simple extenstions of their customers' needs.

Ownership:
	- It is universally true that the greater the participation of the team members who will 
	do the work is in establishing the project objectives, the stronger will be the team 
	members' attachement and sense of ownership of that work.

	- The stronger their sense of ownership is, the more likely it will be that project 
	objectives are met.

System:
	- The project-management system consists of behaviors in three functional areas:
		- planning
		- leading
		- controlling

	- Planning:
		- When planning the work of a team, appropriate planning behaviors can be created 
		using 5 basic management tools, which are:
			- project objectives
			- work-breakdown structure
			- project organization
			- project schedule
			- project-performance baseline (budget)

	- Leading:
		- There are 3 very important and basic behaviors that constitute projecy leadership:
			- communicating
			- team building
			- empowerment

	- Control
		- The control system consists in 3 behaviors:
			- measuring
			- evaluating
			- acting

Teamwork:
	- Project teams builds quality into its service to customers by permitting the sharing of 
	the ideas and the views of the project-team members. The sharing of ideas and views adds 
	technical value to the project.

	- A balance of styles across a company does not appear to be normal; rather, unbalance 
	appears to be the norm. A lack of balance in problem-solving styles is natural, because 
	people tend to pursue work situations in accordance with their preferences.

	- A highly interactive crossfunctional project team creates a balance in the 
	problem-solving style of the team as a whole. By providing project-team members with 
	greater opportunity to interact with each other, to build networks of alliances with one 
	another, and to spend time together, not only is technical value added, but also fewer 
	mistakes are made, quality is improved, and risk is reduced.
