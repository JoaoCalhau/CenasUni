The role of project management in achieving project success

A project can be considered to be the achievement of a specific objective, which involves a 
series of activities and tasks which consume resources. It has to be completed whithin a set 
specification, having definite start and end dates.
Project management can be defined as the process of controlling the achievement of the project
objectives.

Success of a project is dependent on having: (according to Morris and Hugh)
	- a realistic goal
	- competition
	- client satisfaction
	- a definite goal
	- profitability
	- third parties
	- market availiability
	- the implementation process
	- the perceived value of the project

The factors which may cause the project management to fail to achieve it's goal includes:
	- inadequate basis for project
	- wrong person as project manager
	- top management unsupportive
	- inadequately defined tasks
	- lack of project management techniques
	- management techniques mis-used
	- project closedown not planned
	- lack of commitment to project

The completion of a project requires input from a variety of groups including client, the 
prohect team, the parent organization, the producer and the end user. Each party has a role in 
defining and determining success. They all have specific tasks and responsabilities they must 
fulfil in order to achieve success.
The client is expected to be the main party concerned about the success of the project in the 
long term.
The user is the group or individual who makes use of the completed project or product.
The parent organisation will be involved in the project by providing resources.
The project team will shape the implementation of the project.

The overlap between project and project management:
	- Confusion between the two can be caused by 3 factors:
		- Time frame
		- Confusion of Objectives
		- Ease of measurement

	- The confusion above, however, can be avoided by an improved appreciation of the role of 
	project management within the project.

	- The life time of a project has 6 stages:
		- Conception
		- Planning
		- Production
		- Handover
		- Utilisation
		- Closedown

	- Throughout this process the project performance can be assessed in one of 3 ways:
		- The implementation
		- Perceived values
		- Client satisfaction
